         <p class="content3">
          Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state and Queen of Uganda.<br> In October 1963, Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.<br>

          The first post-independence election, held in 1962, was won by an alliance between the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY). UPC and KY<br> formed the first post-independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister,<br> with the Buganda Kabaka (King) Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president.
